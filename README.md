## Getting Started

###Constructing Objects to Acccess Data Stores
A common key-value interface is defined in com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue<K, V>.  This interface is implemented by multiple data stores.  That way, an application program which uses this interface can easily switch between different data store implementations.  In order to use a file system implementation of the key-value interface, the following can be used:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.file.KeyValueFile;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueFile<String, Integer>("db1", true);
~~~
In this example, the keys are strings, and the values are integers.  Each value will be stored in a file whose name is the key.  The files will be in the directory database/db1.  The last parameter, “true”, indicates that all previous files stored in this directory should be deleted.

In order to use an implementation of the key-value interface in which a cache is used which runs in the same process as the application, the following can be used:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.guava.KeyValueGuava;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueGuava<String, Integer>(numObjects);
~~~
where numObjects is the maximum number of objects which can be stored in the cache.  

In order to use an implementation of the key-value interface in which a Redis cache is used, a Redis cache needs to be running in a separate process.  The following can then be used:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.redis.KeyValueRedis;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueRedis<String, Integer>("localhost", 6379, 60);
~~~
In this example, the cache is running on the same node as the application program, 6379 is the port number, and 60 indicates that idle connections should be closed after 60 seconds.

In order to use an implementation of the key-value interface in which a MySQL database is used,
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.sql.KeyValueSQL;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueSQL<String, Integer>("db1", CONFIG_FILE, true);
~~~
In this example, “db1” is the name of the database for storing the key-value data, CONFIG_FILE is a configuration text file, and true indicates that all previous values stored in the database should be deleted.  A skeleton for the configuration file is in the gitub repository file config/sql.config.  The first line is the name of the sql database for storing the data.  The second line is the url for accessing the database.  The third line is the user id, and the fourth line is the password.
In order to pass parameters directly to the KeyValueSQL constructor and avoid using a configuration file, the following constructor can be invoked:
~~~ java
    /**
     * Constructor. Establishes a session with a Key-value store..
     * 
     * @param tableName
     *            identifies the table name for the key-value pairs
     * @param databaseName
     *            database name
     * @param url
     *            base URL for the data service
     * @param userName
     *            user name for authentication
     * @param passWord
     *            password
     */
    public KeyValueSQL(String tblName, String databaseName, String url, String userName, String passWord,
            boolean clearAll);
~~~
	
In order to use an implementation of the KeyValue interface in which Cloudant is used,
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.cloudant.KeyValueCloudant;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueCloudant<String, Integer>("db1", CONFIG_FILE, true);
~~~
In this example, “db1” is the name of the database for storing the key-value data, CONFIG_FILE is a configuration text file, and true indicates that all previous values stored in the database should be deleted.  A skeleton for the configuration file is in the gitub repository file config/cloudant.config.  The first line is the url for the Cloudant account.  The second line is the user id, and the third line is the password.
In order to pass parameters directly to the KeyValueCloudant constructor and avoid using a configuration file, the following constructor can be invoked:
~~~ java
    /**
     * Constructor. Establishes a session with a Key-value store.
     * 
     * @param storeId
     *            identifies the store, could be a URL such as for cloudant
     * @param dbName
     *            identifies the database
     * @param userId
     *            identifies the user
     * @param password
     *            password corresponding to the user
     * @param deletePreviousDb
     *            true if previous version of dbName should be deleted
     */
    public KeyValueCloudant(String storeId, String dbName, String userId, String password, 
            boolean deletePreviousDb)
~~~

In order to use an implementation of the KeyValue interface in which OpenStack Object Storage is used,
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.objectstorage.KeyValueObjectStorage;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue;
    KeyValue<String, Integer> datastore = new KeyValueObjectStorage<String, Integer>("db1", CONFIG_FILE, true);
~~~

In this example, “db1” is the name of the database (container) for storing the key-value data, CONFIG_FILE is a configuration text file, and true indicates that all previous values stored in the database should be deleted.  A skeleton for the configuration file is in the gitub repository file config/objectstorage.config.  The first line is the url for accessing Object Storage.  The second line is the user id, and the third line is the password.
In order to pass parameters directly to the KeyValueObjectStorage constructor and avoid using a configuration file, the following constructor can be invoked:
~~~ java
     /**
      * Constructor. Establishes a session with a Key-value store.
      * 
      * @param dbName
      *            identifies the database
      * @param storeId
      *            Url for the data store
      * @param userId
      *            user ID
      * @param password
      *            password
      * @param clearAll
      *            true if all previous database entries should be deleted
      */
     public KeyValueObjectStorage(String dbName, String storeId, String userId, String password, boolean clearAll)
~~~

The same KeyValue methods are used for each implementation of datastore.  This makes it easy to substitute different implementations of data stores within an application program.  We next show examples of using datastore.  Note that the same method calls could be used with KeyValueCloudant, KeyValueFile, KeyValueGuava, KeyValueRedis, KeyValueSQL, KeyValueObjectStorage, and any other classes which implement the KeyValue interface.

###Methods to Access Data Stores

The following method call adds 42 to the data store indexed by "key1":
~~~ java
    datastore.put(key1, 42);
~~~
The following method call adds all key-value pairs corresponding to "map" to the data store and returns the number of key-value pairs successfully stored:
~~~ java
    int numStored = datastore.putAll(map);
~~~
The following method call returns the value corresponding to "key".  It returns null if "key" is not found in the data store.
~~~ java
    val = datastore.get(key);
~~~
In the following method call, "list" is a list of keys.  getAll looks up all key-value pairs corresponding to keys in "list" and returns a map containing them.  In this example, keys are strings, and values are integers.
~~~ java
    Map<String, Integer> map = datastore.getAll(list);
~~~

The following method call deletes the key-value pair corresponding to "key2" from the data store if present: 
~~~ java
    datastore.delete(key2);
~~~
In the following method call, "list" is a list of keys.  deleteAll deletes all key-value pairs corresponding to a key in "list".  The number of deleted key-value pairs is returned:
~~~ java
    numDeleted = datastore.deleteAll(list);
~~~

The following method call deletes all objects in the data store:
~~~ java
    datastore.clear();
~~~

The following method call outputs a string identifying the type of data store represented by "datastore":
~~~ java
    datastore.storeType();
~~~

The size method returns the number of objects in the data store:
~~~ java
    System.out.println("Data store size: " + datastore.size());
~~~

The following displays the contents of the entire data store.  It should not be invoked if the data store contains a large amount of data as the data outputted would be prohibitively large:
~~~ java
    System.out.println(datastore.toString());
~~~

###Asynchronous (non-blocking) Access to Data Stores
In the previous examples, each method call to access a data store blocks until the data store returns a response. In some cases, it is desirable for an application to access a data store and continue execution without waiting for a response from the data store.
The following creates an object which is used to make asynchronous (non-blocking) calls to a data store; "datastore" is of type KeyValue (which includes any implementation of the KeyValue interface):
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.async.AsyncKeyValue;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValueAsync;
    KeyValueAsync<String, Integer> datastoreAsync = new AsyncKeyValue<String, Integer>(datastore);
~~~

The following is used to store a key-value pair in datastoreAsync asynchronously:
~~~ java
import com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.interfaces.KeyValue.ReturnStatus;
	ListenableFuture<ReturnStatus> listenableFuture = datastoreAsync.putAsync(key2, 43);
~~~
In this example, listenableFuture is a [ListenableFuture](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.html). ListenableFutures extend the Java Future interface by allowing callback functions to be defined which are executed after the computation corresponding to the ListenableFuture has finished executing. More information about ListenableFutures is available [here](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ListenableFutureExplained). Other asynchronous (nonblocking) calls to data stores are defined in https://github.com/aruniyengar/storage-manager/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/storage/storagemanager/implementations/async/AsyncKeyValue.java.



###Monitoring Data Store Performance
The following creates an object which is used to monitor data stores; "datastore" is of type KeyValue (which includes any implementation of the KeyValue interface):
~~~ java
    MonitoredKeyValue<String, Integer> monitoredStore = new MonitoredKeyValue<String, Integer>(datastore, 10);
~~~
where 10 is the number of most recent data points to keep around for each transaction type.  The MonitoredKeyValue class implements an interface which extends the KeyValue interface.  Thus, the same methods used for the KeyValue interface, such as put and get described earlier, can also be applied to monitoredStore.  The key point is that when this is done, "monitoredStore" records performance statistics on the latency for executing those methods.  The methods for accessing, setting, and clearing all of the performance stats are defined in:
https://github.com/aruniyengar/storage-manager/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/storage/storagemanager/interfaces/KeyValueMonitored.java

After "monitoredStore" has been used for accessing a data store, the performance statistics from the data store can be obtained via:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.monitor.RequestStats;
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.implementations.monitor.StorageStats;
        StorageStats stats = monitoredStore.getStorageStats();
        System.out.println(stats.allStats());
        System.out.println("Total number of requests: " + stats.getNumRequests());
        System.out.println("Total time spent on storage: " + stats.getTotalRequestTime());
        System.out.println("Start time: " + stats.getStartTime());
        System.out.println("End time: " + stats.getEndTime());
        stats.setEndTimeNow();
        System.out.println("New End time: " + stats.getEndTime());
        System.out.println("Store type: " + stats.getStoreType());
        RequestStats stats2 = stats.getRequestData(RequestType.PUT);
        System.out.println("Statistics for request type: " + stats2.getRequestType());
        System.out.println("Number of requests: " + stats2.getNumRequests());
        System.out.println("Time taken by requests: " + stats2.getTotalRequestTime());
        System.out.println("Recent request times: " + Arrays.toString(stats2.getRecentRequestTimes()));
~~~

###Determining Data Store Performance with a Workload Generator
The UDSM also includes a workload generator which is used to measure and compare the performance of different data stores.  The performance of different data stores can be compared using the specified workload.  The following can be used to determine the performance of "datastore":
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.performancetester.PerformanceTester;
        PerformanceTester pt = new PerformanceTester(configFile);
        pt.testDataStore(datastore);  // datastore is of type KeyValue<String, byte[]>
~~~
configFile is a string indicating the configuration file specifying the directory for the output files and the parameters for the workload generator.  A skeleton for the configuration file is contained in:
https://github.com/aruniyengar/storage-manager/blob/master/config/performancetest.config
The workload generator outputs performance data in text files which can be visualized using tools such as gnuplot, Excel, and MATLAB.

In order to run the workload generator on multiple data stores using a single method call, the following static method from com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.performancetester.PerformanceTester can be used:
~~~ java
    /**
     * Run all tests, store the results in output files.
     * 
     * @param configFile
     *            file storing configuration parameters
     * @param dataStores
     *            Array containing all data stores to test
     */
    public static void runAllTests(String configFile, ArrayList<KeyValue<String, byte[]>> dataStores);
~~~

There is a JUnit test to easily run performance tests across all data stores currently supported.  This JUnit test is performed by the method:
~~~ java
    public void allTests();
~~~
in the Java class:
https://github.com/aruniyengar/storage-manager/blob/master/src/test/java/com/ibm/storage/storagemanager/performancetester/tests/PerformanceTests.java

###Going Beyond the Generic Key-Value Interface: Using Individual Features of a Specific Data Store
When Redis is being used, it may be desirable to use features of Redis which go beyond the methods offered by the KeyValue interface.  The following KeyValueRedis method returns a data structure corresponding to the Jedis interface for Redis which allows application programs to access the cache using Jedis methods:
~~~ java
    /**
     * Return underlying Jedis object for applications to explicitly use.
     * 
     * @return value underlying Jedis object representing cache
     * 
     * */
    public Jedis getDatabase();
~~~

When an SQL store is being used, it may be desirable to issue SQL queries which go beyond the methods offered by the KeyValue interface.  The following KeyValueSQL method returns a connection data structure which allows application programs to make SQL queries using JDBC: 
~~~ java
    /**
     * Return database connection for applications to explicitly use.
     * 
     * @return connection to database
     * 
     * */
    public Connection getConnection();
~~~

When Cloudant is being used, it may be desirable to access Cloudant in ways which go beyond the methods offered by the KeyValue interface.  The following KeyValueCloudant method returns a data structure which allows application programs to access Cloudant using the Cloudant Java client:
~~~ java
    /**
     * Return underlying Database object for applications to explicitly use.
     * 
     * @return value underlying Database object representing database
     * 
     * */
    public Database getDatabase();
~~~

When Object Storage is being used, it may be desirable to access Object Storage in ways which go beyond the methods offered by the KeyValue interface.  The Java library for OpenStack Storage (JOSS) provides a convenient Java interface for using Object Storage. The following KeyValueObjectStorage method returns a Container object which allows application programs to access the data store using JOSS:
~~~ java
     /**
      * Return underlying container for applications to explicitly use.
      * 
      * @return value underlying Container object representing database
      * 
      * */
     public Container getDatabase();
~~~

###Encryption and Decryption
In order to use encryption and decryption, the following class should be imported:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.storagemanager.util.Encryption;
~~~

The following method call generates an encryption key for encrypting data: 
~~~ java
    Encryption.Key secretKey = Encryption.generateKey();
~~~

The following method call encrypts "hm" using encryption key "secretKey": 
~~~ java
    SealedObject so = Encryption.encrypt(hm, secretKey);
~~~

The following method call decrypts "so" using encryption key "secretKey":
~~~ java
    HashMap<String, Integer> hm2 = Encryption.decrypt(so, secretKey);
~~~

###Compression and Decompression
In order to use compression and decompression, the following class should be imported:
~~~ java
import com.ibm.storage.clientlibrary.Util;
~~~

The following method call compresses “hm”: 
~~~ java
    byte[] compressed = Util.compress(hm);
~~~

The following method call decompresses “compressed”: 
~~~ java
    HashMap<String, Integer> hm2 = Util.decompress(compressed);
~~~
